# Movie Recommendation using Machine Learning 


---

### Project Description: Building Process

> **In this project, we have created a decentralised freelancing community which enables zero knowledge transparency and authentic business between clients and freelancers. Clients and Freelancers collaborate and communicate through push notification and push Chat Dapp. WorldCoins is used for authentication and check if the user is human or not.  IPFS is used for blockchain storage and eventually the platform is deployed on vialist.**

## ðŸ›  Technologies used
:

1) First, you need a dataset of movies and their features. This can include attributes such as genre, cast, director, release year, rating, and plot summary.
Preprocess the data by cleaning, formatting, and transforming it into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.

2)Use a supervised machine learning algorithm, such as a decision tree or random forest, to train a model on the dataset. The model should take in a user's preferences and output a list of recommended movies.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's accuracy and prevent overfitting.
Use techniques such as cross-validation and grid search to optimize the model's hyperparameters and improve its performance.


3)Incorporate user feedback into the model to continually improve its recommendations over time.
Deploy the model as a web application or API to make movie recommendations for users based on their preferences.
Consider incorporating additional features, such as movie posters or trailers, to enhance the user experience and engagement with the system.
Regularly update the dataset with new movies and features to ensure that the recommendation system stays up-to-date and relevant to users.


4)Monitor the system's performance and feedback from users to identify areas for improvement and enhance the overall user experience.
